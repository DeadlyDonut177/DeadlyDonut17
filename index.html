								<h4>My name is Christoffel Albertus Pyper. <br>
									Student No. : s3932311<br>
									Student Email:</h4>
								<p>I was born in beautiful South Africa where I have spent most of my life.
									When I was quite young my family moved to Australia to gain citizenship, and while I was still very young, we moved back to South Africa. I have spent equal amounts of my life in both nations, and I can say with ease, I have thoroughly enjoyed both. I have always been successful in my city life, however my family and childhood life is deeply connected with the South African Bushveld culture. With this, I am perfectly fluent in both English and Afrikaans. Afrikaans is a language remnant of Dutch, similar to it, but influenced by other African languages, with this I have a taste of understanding of these other African languages.
									</p>
									<p>I just recently finished High School in South Africa, and have decided to begin my online IT/Computer Science related studies.</p>
									<p>I have had several interests and hobbies, from home-chemistry to Arduino and Robotics, but one I think many people may find interesting was my dabble into the world of implants. Here I used my chemistry knowledge as well as my interest in biology, and learned about making biocompatible materials and coatings. From this information I was able to coat a small neodymium magnet in a biocompatible coating, create a sterile environment, and implant the magnet into my left ring finger.
										This effectively caused myself to gain a sixth sense: sensitivity to magnetic fields. I could feel electricity in a wire, pieces of steel, and other small magnets. Requiring such a great clashing of subjects and knowledge, it was undoubtedly one of my most daring and technically demanding projects I have ever worked on.
										</p>
										<p>Along with my love of nature, I have a great love for animals, and have two German Shepherds, and along with them, I love remaining physically active, going for walks, runs, and gym workouts daily.</p>

							<article id="interests">
								<h2 class="major">Interest In IT</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images\RMIT.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>What is My Interest in IT? When did my interest in IT start?</h3>
								<p>My interest in IT is directed toward Robotics and Software Engineering.
									I have been programming since I was 13 or 14, having discovered it and how rewarding and fun it can be, right before I entered High School. I have touched on building bots with Python, Websites with JavaScript, and Programs with Java. I started learning Arduino a few years ago and met my favourite hobby, building odd and fun mechanical/electronic robots. My discovery of it was in school, when my friends and I found my technology class. Here, a really cool teacher showed me his interesting builds, in 3D printing, along with some JavaScript code and I immediately wanted to continue talking to him, and wanted to build something alongside him. This was my gateway to my love for IT.</p>
									<h3>Why did I choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
									<p>I still have some close family living here in Melbourne, and in order to be close to them, I decided to come to a university in Melbourne.
										I started doing research, and I found out about RMIT.
										I wanted to come to a University with a specialty in Technology. After finding out about RMIT and its programs, I knew that this was the perfect university for me.</p>
										<h3>What do I expect to learn during my studies?</h3>
										<p>I’m currently hoping and expecting to learn some computer theory on how computers as a whole work. I'm expecting to severely expand my programming knowledge and skill, and I want to learn more about various techniques and algorithms useful for making other programs. I’m sure this course will also expose me to useful physical and virtual tools, such as different languages to program in, or different programs, to make my life better, and learning IT easier, and even more interesting.</p>

								<h3>What the results of these tests mean for me</h3>
								<p>These results provide for me an insight into how I think, act and behave compared to others. I however, do not think these are the bounds of how I should behave, but a measure of how I currently do. I expect these results to change and variate over the next few years.</p>
								<h3>How I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team</h3>
								<p>The results themselves show that I am more independently orientated.
									In a team scenario, I might be more inclined to find work to do, and complete it on mhy own. I think I would be slightly likely to deviate from working collaboratively. My learning style test proves I would prefer to, and function better, working on a physical project.</p>
								<h3>How I plan to take this into account when forming a team</h3>
								<p>I should focus intensely on working collaboratively with others. The Myers-Briggs results show that I may fare well as a group leader, though I believe my communication skills proved by other results might impede on this ability. I think that even though I should focus more on collaborating, that if I were handed solo-work, I would work most efficiently.</p>

							<article id="project">
								<h2 class="major">Project Idea</h2>
								<p>I thought for a long time about what exactly would improve not only my life, but other’s lives, and would do it in a cheap, and logistically possible manner, such that everyone may have access to and benefit from it. My idea is quite simple. Using a sort of person-detection system, along with a stepper motor and an on-board computer, create an air conditioner or fan that consistently directs temperature-regulated air to the location of where a person is, or people are in a room.</p>
								<p>Coming from South Africa, and now living in Australia, I understand very well the tiring pain of being uncomfortable from sitting in a room too hot or cold. Now that we are entering the summer, I think most Australians would agree with me that innovation in temperature regulation is needed right now. At least in our first world country, we have the technological ability to simply blow air to wherever we’re sitting, and yet here we are, lacking an auto air conditioner. I am not impressed by our current global air conditioners that heat or cool an entire building, but a localised heating and cooling solution will be more energy efficient than any alternative.
								</p>
								<p>For simplicity, from here on we’ll call this product AutoCooler.<br>
									AutoCooler will detect where a person is in a room, then will rotate a typical fan toward the direction of where that person is. This breaks down and may become confusing when multiple people are in a room, but some simple software adjustments can account for this, which I will explain later. AutoCooler consists of two independent heads. Both heads are operated by a two axis gimbal. The first head holds the fan or could hold an air conditioning unit duct, while the second head holds the person detector sensor. Again for simplicity, we’ll rename the first head to the ‘fan’ and the second head to the ‘sensor’. Both the fan and the sensor are operated by an on-board microcontroller, and physically moved by two stepper motors. Initially when starting the AutoCoolerer, the fan will direct air in whichever direction it is facing. Immediately upon startup however, the sensor will begin scanning. The sensor will begin to slowly rotate and nod up and down until the entire room has been scanned. Detecting the physically warmest spots in the room, the sensor sends this data to the microcontroller, which in turns commands the fan to rotate and nod to meet that particular position. The sensor never turns off, as long as the AutoCoolerer is still on. This way, the fan is always pointed in the direction of a person in the room. A modified AutoCoolerer uses multiple sensors attached to the same sensor head, each facing a different direction. This way, more information can be gathered faster, allowing for faster and more accurate updates sent to the fan. A problem some may have thought of is the issue of having multiple people in the same room. This issue is edited by software in the microcontroller, and can be adjusted by the user as they choose. If the sensor or sensors detect multiple separate hotspots, the fan head will focus on one hotspot for a decided amount of time, before alternating to a different hotspot. By adjusting a knob on the AutoCoolerer, the user can dictate the length of this set time.
									A manual mode is also available, by pressing the mode button, thus switching modes, and by momentarily pressing on 1 or multiple of 4 buttons on the AutoCoolerer, the fan head can be rotated to point in the specific direction of the user’s choosing. The sensor will continue to scan, to allow for instantaneous return to automatic mode, without the delay of rescanning the room.
									 A third mode is available. Possibly for secret use on a roommate or girlfriend, the microcontroller is reprogrammed to direct the fan head in the exact opposite direction of a person in a room.
									With these modes, a simple technological improvement is brought to the world, adding to the great rise in automation, and to the possibilities of ways to annoy housemates.
									</p>
								<p>For the manufacturing of this product, a base can be either injection molded or 3D printed out of plastic, alternatively other materials of bases can be used. Both the sensor and fan head can be rotated 360 degrees using a stepper motor, while the nodding function for Y-Axis control can be filled by using a simple servo. The fan head makes use of an ordinary desktop fan, but design iterations may allow for air conditioning ducts to be used. The sensor head is more tricky, but after some interesting deliberation, it is decided that a single pixel IR camera would be a lightweight, cheap, simple and fulfilling heat sensor.</p>
								<p>A large amount of skill is required during the design process, while the operation, and large scale production of this device will not be skill demanding. A mount for the build must be first 3D modelled, which will require knowledge of 3D modelling as well as knowledge about the manufacturing process. All physical parts, besides the custom base, can be sourced from local appropriate suppliers. The software will take a large amount of skill. A semi-complex algorithm will be programmed, to notice clusters of “warm” pixels, and these must then be assigned as being single people, or groups of people, and take user input to determine the length of time the fan must then focus on these spots. Additionally, a simple algorithm must be coded to determine the difference between the temperature of empty spaces, and people.</p>
								<p>If this product can be manufactured, shipped and sold for a low price, these could become as commercialised as regular rotating desktop fans.
									People will cease to have to worry about feeling comfortable while working or relaxing. The guilt of paying large bills or using inefficient full building coolers and heaters will also be eliminated. With this I believe firmly, that with better relaxed, and more efficient working people, our economy and society as a whole will work better, faster and happier.

								<h2 class="major">My Ideal Job</h2>
								<h5>This is one job I found particularly Appealing:</h5>
								<a href="https://au.linkedin.com/jobs/view/head-of-information-technology-at-fourquarters-recruitment-2836490291?refId=qlhZscRghC7%2FtBArt%2BEt%2BQ%3D%3D&trackingId=bCd4S1g0fFtA6AueF963uA%3D%3D&trk=public_jobs_topcard-title"><h4><u>Head of Information Technology</u></h4></a>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images\Screenshot (845).png" alt="" /></span>
								<h4>Description</h4>
								<p>This position requires that
									a person not only manages
									the entire IT department, but
									works on all IT related technical
									issues, regardless of the issue’s
									level or position.
									I am drawn to this as I generally
									love the idea of managing 
									and believe I have or can gain
									the capability to lead a group 
									of like-minded people.
									I also enjoy working
									in the field, and am sure I will
									never become bored with
									day to day issues, and will rather
									enjoy solving them. This job in
									particular, has specialty in
									finances, one subject which I
									take a great amount of interest in.
									</p>
									<p>This position requires a unique set of skills, knowledge and experience that is not often found in other jobs.
										In this position, a person must have excellent communication skills, extensive knowledge and understanding about the most technical aspects of the IT department’s potential issues and problems. In addition to this, about 5 years worth of experience in IT management and systems engineering, and clear and competent management of the whole department and its workers, IT policies and practices, and strong business acumen will be demanded in day-to-day life. Other technical qualifications include: a bachelor's degree in a relevant field, experience within financial services, managing and providing strong relations with third party vendors and support.
										This, anyone would agree, is a very large laundry-list of qualifications and requirements, all of which I must achieve in the next few years. To simplify and organise this, it is a good idea to break it down to: what I have already achieved, what I am actively working toward, and what I must still begin working toward. Along with this I can include, if applicable, appropriate and detailed plans to any negative or lacking aspect to my current skill or experience set.
										</p>
									<p>First, my already obtained abilities: I believe, through jobs and school, I have been able to gain a strong business acumen, a good understanding of how to manage others in a team, and have a sufficient enough understanding of the financial services that may be needed for this particular position. The financial aspect of this job does not particularly concern me, as I have stated, I have a well enough understanding of it. Besides that, the financial aspect is particular to this job, and another job, equal to this one, at a different company, may have a different speciality.
									</p>
										<p>Second is what I am working toward. The most obvious of this is my relevant Bachelor’s, which I am actively working on.
											During this course and as I have continued working on IT through my free-time, challenging myself wherever possible, I will slowly and consistently gain knowledge about any potential problems that may be faced by anyone working within an IT related field. This will also be greatly assisted by taking smaller jobs directly out of University.
											As I am slightly introverted, I am admittedly lacking in my communication skills, an essential part of this job. Throughout University, and considering I am on the young side, and that I have just recently moved country to Australia, I will have ample opportunity to make new connections and stretch my social and communication related experience. In addition to knowledge about potential problems in practice, I will also require extensive understanding about the theory of anything and everything IT. This will be solved similarly to my demand for practical
											experience, as I shall certainly gain great knowledge and information during my studies, and personal practices.											
											</p>
											<p>Third is what I have yet to begin working toward, and desire to achieve or gain within the next 8 years.
												I should become familiar with the appropriate policies and practices that companies follow in order to remain ethical and secure. Though I have not begun learning about this, during this course and many others like it, I should discover the contents of appropriate ethical practices and policies of major corporations. Another lack in my skill set is my knowledge about systems engineering and the function of an IT department as a whole. As with my determination to learn about the policies of companies, this can be solved by taking smaller jobs right out of university, and from learning during University courses. Lastly is about maintaining good relations with 3rd party IT vendors. I am unsure about an exact method for learning this, but hope that working in a lower level IT position will teach me everything necessary to know about this skill.
